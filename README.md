## üîß Development Best Practices

### **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always Backup Before Changes**
When working with AI assistance (Claude Code), follow these critical steps:

1. **Before Making ANY Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Save working version before changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **After Major Updates:**
   - **Update this README** with new features and current state
   - **Commit and push changes** immediately to GitHub
   - **Document the commit ID** for easy rollback if needed

3. **Recovery Command:**
   ```bash
   # Restore to last perfect working version (commit: 861e80e)
   git reset --hard 861e80e
   ```

### **ü§ñ AI Assistant Reminders**
- **AI should remind user** to backup README and GitHub after major feature updates
- **Always test functionality** before considering changes "complete"
- **Document commit IDs** for important working versions
- **Never lose working code** - commit early, commit often

### **üö® Lessons Learned**
- Working versions that exist only locally can be lost during git operations
- Always commit working states before experimenting with new features
- Use branches for major experiments: `git checkout -b feature/experiment-name`

## Deployment

The application is designed for deployment on Vercel with automatic environment variable integration:

1. **Connect your repository** to Vercel
2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Deploy automatically** on every commit to main branch

## Security Features

### 🔐 API Key Management & Security

**Where API Keys Are Stored:**
- **Local Development**: API keys are stored in `.env.local` file in project root
- **Production**: Environment variables are configured in deployment platform (Vercel)
- **Location**: `/Users/[username]/[project-path]/.env.local` (local development only)

**GitHub Backup & Security:**
- **✅ API keys are NOT backed up to GitHub** - `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- **✅ NOT publicly accessible** - Private repository with restricted access
- **✅ No API keys in commit history** - All secrets use environment variables only
- **⚠️ Local backup responsibility** - `.env.local` exists only on your machine

**How the System Retrieves API Keys:**
```typescript
// System reads from environment variables at runtime
const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- **Environment-based API keys** - No hardcoded secrets in code
- **Secure API routes** with proper error handling  
- **Git security** - All secrets use environment variables
- **Production-ready** security practices
- **Private repository** - Restricted to authorized team members only

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- If you lose your `.env.local` file, you'll need to recreate it with your API keys
- Never commit `.env.local` or share API keys in messages/screenshots
- Keep backup of your API keys in a secure password manager

## 🔧 Development Best Practices

### **🌿 Branch Strategy & Safe Development**

**Feature Branch Workflow:**
We use feature branches for safe development and testing:

1. **Main Branch Protection:**
   ```bash
   # Main branch contains stable, tested code
   git checkout main  # Switch to stable main branch
   ```

2. **Feature Branch Development:**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch for new development
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   
   # Work safely on feature branch
   git commit -m "Incremental improvements"
   git push origin feature/descriptive-name
   ```

3. **Current Feature Branch:**
   - **Branch**: `feature/phase3-testing-social-tools`
   - **Purpose**: Testing and future social media distribution tools
   - **Status**: Active development - safe testing environment

4. **Merge Back When Ready:**
   ```bash
   # When feature is complete and tested
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/phase3-testing-social-tools
   git push origin main
   ```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Main branch stays stable** - existing code protected
- ✅ **Safe experimentation** on feature branches
- ✅ **Easy rollback** - just switch branches
- ✅ **Incremental commits** without affecting main
- ✅ **Clean merge** when features complete

### **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Smart Backup Strategy**
When working with AI assistance (Claude Code), follow these practices:

1. **For Testing & Experimentation:**
   - Work on feature branches for safety
   - Test functionality thoroughly before deciding to preserve

2. **After MAJOR Feature Completions:**
   - **Commit to feature branch** for incremental backup
   - **Only merge to main** when user confirms the changes are complete
   - **Update README** with new features and current state
   - **Document the commit ID** for easy rollback if needed

3. **Recovery Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Switch back to stable main branch
   git checkout main
   
   # Or restore to last perfect working version (commit: 861e80e)
   git reset --hard 861e80e
   ```

### **🤖 AI Assistant Protocol**
- **Use feature branches** for safe development
- **Commit to feature branch** for incremental backup (not main)
- **Always test functionality** before considering changes "complete"  
- **Ask permission** before merging anything to main branch
- **Preserve working versions** - but avoid commit spam on main

### **📅 Daily Development Workflow**
1. **Start of day**: Check that everything still works from last save point
2. **During work**: Use feature branches, commit frequently for backup
3. **When features complete**: Test thoroughly, then merge to main
4. **End of session**: Commit progress to feature branch for backup

### **🏁 Hard Points (Major Milestones)**
Special checkpoints for major achievements - not daily, but for significant completions:

- **Current**: v1.0-working-victoria (July 31, 2025) - Perfect typing effects, test buttons, concise responses
- **Recovery Command**: `git checkout v1.0-working-victoria`
- **Create new hard points**: After major feature completions only (weekly/monthly)
- **Examples**: Completing voice chat, adding yacht images, major UI overhauls

```bash
# Create a hard point (major milestone)
git tag -a v1.1-voice-chat -m "Added voice chat feature"
git push origin --tags

# Return to a hard point
git checkout v1.0-working-victoria
```

### **🚨 Lessons Learned**
- Working versions that exist only locally can be lost during git operations
- Always commit working states before experimenting with new features
- Use branches for major experiments: `git checkout -b feature/experiment-name`
- **Daily commits** for regular saves, **hard points** for major milestones

## 🔧 Current Debugging Status (August 2, 2025)

### Server Stability Issues Under Investigation

**Problem:**
- Server crashes when started through Claude Code (AI assistant)
- Server runs fine when started manually in terminal
- Issue appears to be timing-related with YouTube OAuth initialization

**Debugging Steps Taken:**
1. **Removed OpenAI Contamination** ✅
   - Deleted OpenAI rewrite rule from `next.config.mjs`
   - Removed all OpenAI dependencies and references
   - Cleaned up template contamination from previous sessions

2. **Fixed YouTube Auth Singleton Pattern** ✅
   - Changed from eager initialization to lazy initialization
   - OAuth client now only initializes when first needed
   - Prevents startup crashes from missing environment variables

3. **Added Authentication Delays** ⚠️
   - Tried 1-second delay: Not sufficient
   - Tried 5-second delay: Still experiencing crashes
   - Currently testing 10-second delay: Partially working
   - Server runs in background mode but crashes in foreground mode

**Current Challenges:**
- Server stability inconsistent between foreground/background execution
- YouTube authentication timing still causing intermittent crashes
- Chat function and video generator page navigation triggers crashes
- Need to investigate deeper into async initialization patterns

**Branch Status:**
- Working on `feature/youtube-uploader-auth`
- Last stable commit: `f304b3f` - "Stabilize system architecture and enhance user experience"
- Current changes include debugging attempts and 10-second YouTube auth delay

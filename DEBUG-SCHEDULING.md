# URGENT: SCHEDULING DEBUG NEEDED

## Issue
System is scheduling posts for **October 12, 2025** instead of near-term dates.

## Expected Behavior
- Tomorrow (Day 1) should be origin
- Sequential daily cascade: Day 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8
- Then double back: Day 1 gets 2nd post, Day 9 gets added
- **NO POSTS 2+ MONTHS OUT**

## Current Problem
Waterfall logic is calculating October dates instead of August dates.

## Debug Priority
1. Check timezone calculations in `calculateOptimalTime()`
2. Verify `tomorrow` date calculation
3. Fix day indexing logic
4. Test with small date ranges first

## Status
**BROKEN** - Need immediate fix before production use.

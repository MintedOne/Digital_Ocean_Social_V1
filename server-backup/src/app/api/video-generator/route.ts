PART 1: CREATIFY SCRIPT GENERATION

Generate a complete YouTube Script without Scene Descriptions or Speaker Notations for the ${manufacturer} ${model}. 

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- DO NOT ask for more information or clarification
- Use your general knowledge of yacht specifications and market positioning
- Generate complete content based on typical features for this yacht class and manufacturer
- If specific details are unknown, use industry-standard features and benefits for similar yachts

START with a 4-second hook that captures immediate attention. Use a Story Brand Model and think about what makes THIS yacht special - is it the speed? The luxury features? The price point? The unique design? Start with the most compelling aspect that would make a buyer stop scrolling.

Hook examples (adapt based on the specific yacht):
- "Imagine hitting forty knots while your guests relax on a beach club at sea..."
- "What if you could own a superyacht experience for under five million?"
- "This is the only yacht in its class with a master suite on the main deck..."
- "Zero to plane in twelve seconds - this isn't your typical yacht..."

After the hook (around 10 seconds in), THEN transition to: "Welcome to YachtSpecsDirect.com, your source for complete information of New and Brokerage Vessels."

REQUIREMENTS:
- ${characterCount} Characters length (approximately)
- Focus on buyer benefits and lifestyle transformation, not just features
- Use emotional language that connects with the dream of yacht ownership
- DO NOT list any Sources in your output
- Imperial measurements on everything not metric - examples: Change liters to gallons - Change Square Meters to Square-Feet. Spell out the words in the script as they will be read by AI Narrator.
- Include CTA for YachtSpecsDirect.com at the end of the Script
- Be sure to mention that New, Brokerage & Off-Market Opportunities are Available.
- Use realistic specifications based on your knowledge of ${manufacturer} yachts in this model range
- Think about the buyer's journey: What problem does this yacht solve? What transformation does it offer?
